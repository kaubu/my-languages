# Nouns
Artein nouns have no genders.

*Simple* noun stems **must** be one syllable, and **must** begin and end with a consonant.

The accent will ***almost* always** fall on the stem’s nucleus vowel, rather than the declension or prelude. In compound stems, the accent is always marked by default, and almost always falls on the head (e.g. in mailbox the head would be 'box', since above all, it is a box).
## Case
Artein has five cases: absolutive (ABS), ergative (ERG), genitive (GEN), vocative (VOC), and dative/prepositional (DAT/PREP, prefer PREP).

The dictionary form (lemma) of words is the absolutive singular.
### Absolutive
The absolutive is used in the following functions:
1. Core argument of an intransitive verb
	2. — **He** slept
2. Object of a transitive verb
	1. — I hate **you**
3. Predicate of the copula
	1. — **You** will be **alright** (common copula)
	2. — **Warriors** are **brave** (gnomic copula)
### Ergative
The Ergative is used in the following functions:
1. Agent of a transitive verb
	1. — **She** wanted a cat
### Genitive
The Genitive is used in the following functions:
1. Indicating possession
	1. — the man's hat
	2. — the woman's children
2. Indicating material of composition
	1. — a ring of gold, a golden ring
	2. — shoes of leather, leather shoes
### Vocative
The Vocative is used in direct address:
1. — Hey **John**!
2. — Are you alright, **Sophia**?
### Dative/Prepositional
The Prepositional covers both the prepositional and dative cases. This is used in the following functions:
1. When using prepositional prefixes (prefixes that function as prepositions)
	1. — I want to go to America
	2. — She hit him with a hammer
