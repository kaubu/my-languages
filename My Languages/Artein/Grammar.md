# Nouns
Artein nouns have no genders.

*Simple* noun stems **must** be one syllable, and **must** begin and end with a consonant.

The accent will ***almost* always** fall on the stem’s nucleus vowel, rather than the declension or prelude. In compound stems, the accent is always marked by default, and almost always falls on the head (e.g. in mailbox the head would be 'box', since above all, it is a box).
## Case
Artein has five cases: absolutive (ABS), ergative (ERG), genitive (GEN), vocative (VOC), and dative/prepositional (DAT/PREP, prefer PREP).

The dictionary form (lemma) of words is the absolutive singular.
### Absolutive
The absolutive is used in the following functions:
1. Core argument of an intransitive verb
	2. — **He** slept
2. Object of a transitive verb
	1. — I hate **you**
3. Predicate of the copula
	1. — **You** will be **alright** (common copula)
	2. — **Warriors** are **brave** (gnomic copula)
### Ergative
The Ergative is used in the following functions:
1. Agent of a transitive verb
	1. — **She** wanted a cat
### Genitive
The Genitive is used in the following functions:
1. Indicating possession
	1. — the man's hat
	2. — the woman's children
2. Indicating material of composition
	1. — a ring of gold, a golden ring
	2. — shoes of leather, leather shoes
### Vocative
The Vocative is used in direct address:
1. — Hey **John**!
2. — Are you alright, **Sophia**?
### Dative/Prepositional
The Prepositional covers both the prepositional and dative cases. This is used in the following functions:
1. When using prepositional prefixes (prefixes that function as prepositions)
	1. — I want to go to America
	2. — She hit him with a hammer
## Declension
Regular nouns decline like so:

| Case                     | Singular (SG) | Dual (DU) | Plural (PL) |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Absolutive (ABS)**     | -             | -ina      | -i          |
| **Ergative (ERG)**       | -a            | -ara      | -an         |
| **Genitive (GEN)**       | -is           | -ites     | -ise        |
| **Vocative (VOC)**       | -o            | -or       | -on         |
| **Prepositional (PREP)** | -in           | -en       | -e          |

# Articles
There is no indefinite article in Artein, so depending on context *mel* can mean "cat" or "a cat".

The definite article has three forms depending on the situation: *ci*, *ce*, and *cai*.

Articles precede the noun they modify, and they decline for number (dual number is lost), but not for case:

|                 | Singular (SG) | Plural (PL) | Use case                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Common noun** | ci            | cin         | Used for most other nouns that don't fit into the other categories |
| **Proper noun** | ce            | cen         | Used for proper nouns                                              |
| **Divine noun** | cai           | cain        | Used for nouns related to religion                                 |

# Adjectives
Almost all adjectives in Artein can be used either predicatively or attributively. A predicative adjective is one that forms a part of the predicate, like *red* in the sentence *The car is red*. An attributive adjective directly modifies a noun, as in *the red car*.

Unlike noun stems, adjective stems are not required to start and end with a consonant.

Adjectives, even if the stress falls on the second syllable, do not loose their stress marking.

A predicate adjective in Artein does not inflect:
* *Tin díles **mirí** ea* — That man is **small**
* *Ti dílesi **mirí** sia* — Those men are **small**
* *Tin dílla **mirí** ea* — This woman is small
* *Ti díllai **mirí** sia* — Those women are **small**

A predicate adjective expressing a value judgement is often preceded by the particle [[iu]]. This is similar to Irish as well.
