# Nouns
Artein nouns have no genders.

*Simple* noun stems **must** be one syllable, and **must** begin and end with a consonant.

The accent will ***almost* always** fall on the stem’s nucleus vowel, rather than the declension or prelude. In compound stems, the accent is always marked by default, and almost always falls on the head (e.g. in mailbox the head would be 'box', since above all, it is a box).
## Case
Artein has five cases: absolutive (ABS), ergative (ERG), genitive (GEN), vocative (VOC), and dative/prepositional (DAT/PREP, prefer PREP).

The dictionary form (lemma) of words is the absolutive singular.
### Absolutive
The absolutive is used in the following functions:
1. Core argument of an intransitive verb
	2. — **He** slept
2. Object of a transitive verb
	1. — I hate **you**
3. Predicate of the copula
	1. — **You** will be **alright** (common copula)
	2. — **Warriors** are **brave** (gnomic copula)
### Ergative
The Ergative is used in the following functions:
1. Agent of a transitive verb
	1. — **She** wanted a cat
### Genitive
The Genitive is used in the following functions:
1. Indicating possession
	1. *ci dílesis tam* — the man's hat
	2. *ci díllais nem* — the woman's children
2. Indicating material of composition
	1. *fáris lond* — a ring of gold, a golden ring
	2. — shoes of leather, leather shoes
### Vocative
The Vocative is used in direct address:
1. — Hey **John**!
2. — Are you alright, **Sophia**?
### Dative/Prepositional
The Prepositional covers both the prepositional and dative cases. This is used in the following functions:
1. When using prepositional prefixes (prefixes that function as prepositions)
	1. — I want to go to America
	2. — She hit him with a hammer
## Declension
Regular nouns decline like so:

| Case                     | Singular (SG) | Dual (DU) | Plural (PL) |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Absolutive (ABS)**     | -             | -ina      | -i          |
| **Ergative (ERG)**       | -a            | -ara      | -an         |
| **Genitive (GEN)**       | -is           | -ites     | -ise        |
| **Vocative (VOC)**       | -o            | -or       | -on         |
| **Prepositional (PREP)** | -in           | -en       | -e          |
### Irregular nouns

# Articles
There is no indefinite article in Artein, so depending on context *mel* can mean "cat" or "a cat".

The definite article has three forms depending on the situation: *ci*, *ce*, and *cai*.

Articles precede the noun they modify, and they decline for number (dual number is lost), but not for case:

|                 | Singular (SG) | Plural (PL) | Use case                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Common noun** | ci            | cei         | Used for most other nouns that don't fit into the other categories |
| **Proper noun** | ce            | cen         | Used for proper nouns                                              |
| **Divine noun** | cai           | cain        | Used for nouns related to religion                                 |

When two definite noun phrases appear as part of a genitive construction (equivalent to *the X of the Y* in English), only the noun phrase in the genitive takes the article. Note that genitive constructions can appear in any order, but the first element is what is emphasized. Compare:
* *mas **ci** rínesis* — **the** *home* of **the** King (common order)
* ***ci** rínesis mas* — **the** *king's* \[the\] home (less common order)
* *hail **ci** rúrise* — **the** *flight* of **the** eagles (common order)
* ***ci** rúrise hail* — **the** *eagles'* flight (less common order)
# Adjectives
Almost all adjectives in Artein can be used either predicatively or attributively. A predicative adjective is one that forms a part of the predicate, like *red* in the sentence *The car is red*. An attributive adjective directly modifies a noun, as in *the red car*.

Unlike noun stems, adjective stems are not required to start and end with a consonant.

Adjectives, even if the stress falls on the second syllable, do not lose their stress marking.

A predicate adjective in Artein does not inflect:
* *Tin díles **mirí** ea* — That man is **small**
* *Ti dílesi **mirí** sia* — Those men are **small**
* *Tin dílla **mirí** ea* — This woman is **small**
* *Ti díllai **mirí** sia* — Those women are **small**

A predicate adjective expressing a value judgement is often preceded by the particle [[iu]]. This is similar to Irish as well.
* *Al **iu** caíra iar* — I'm fine (lit. I am good)
* *Ci som **iu** tírun ea* — The story is bad
* *Ci reìmsún **iu** naíla gher* — The weather was beautiful

In some dialects and colloquial speech, *iu* has fallen out of usage.

An attributive adjective mostly follows the noun and is inflected for number but not person:
* *ci díles **mirí*** — the small man
* *ci dílesi **mirín*** — the small men
* *ci dílesis **mirí*** — of the small man
* *ci dílesitès **mirín*** — of the small men
## Declension
| Attributive adjective declension | Singular (SG) | Dual (DU) | Plural (PL) |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Postvocalic                      | -             | -r        | -n          |
| Postconsonantal                  | -             | -ar       | -an         |

## Comparative and superlative
Adjectives can express comparative, negative comparative, and superlative forms using adverbs.

These adverbs go **AFTER** definite articles.

|                      | Adverb | English equivalent     |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Comparative          | ie     | more happy             |
| Negative comparative | nie    | not more happy         |
| Superlative          | scei   | most happy or happiest |

# Adverbs
Artein verbs are used to modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.

An adverb can be created from an adjective by adding the particle [[iu]] before it. If the adjective begins with a vowel, *gh* is added before it, e.g. **((TODO: ADD ADJECTIVES BEGINNING WITH A VOWEL)**

Other categories of adverbs include the following:
* Adverbs that describe relation to time, e.g. (sometimes), (now), (already), etc
* Adverbs that describe relation to place, e.g. (there), (homewards, to/for home), (out, outside; away, at a distance, afar), etc
* Adverbs used in questions, e.g. (when), (how, what matter), (where)
* Adverbs used for negation, e.g. (preverbal particle), (introduces negative questions, both indirect and direct), etc
* Other adverbs, e.g. (however), (as well, in addition, also), (chiefly in the negative: either)
# Verbs
Arteinis verb forms are constructed chiefly synthetically. These forms express **person** and **number** as a prefix, and **tense** and **aspect** as a suffix.

Person and number conjugations can be dropped if a pronoun is added, and vice versa.

Stress is always kept on the verb stem, and, in the case of compound stems, on the head or main part of the stem. There is no need to specify the primary stress if it falls on the second syllable.
## Explanations
### Tense
#### Past
The past tense is a grammatical tense whose function is to place an action or situation in the past. Examples of verbs in the past tense include the English verbs *sang*, *went* and *washed*. 

Most languages have a past tense, with some having several types in order to indicate how far back the action took place.
#### Present
The present tense (abbreviated PRS) is a grammatical tense whose principal function is to locate a situation or event in the present time. The present tense is used for actions which are happening now.
#### Future
In grammar, a future tense (abbreviated FUT) is a verb form that generally marks the event described by the verb as not having happened yet, but expected to happen in the future.
### Aspect
#### Imperfective
The imperfective (abbreviated IPFV) is a grammatical aspect used to describe ongoing, habitual, repeated, or similar semantic roles, whether that situation occurs in the past, present, or future.

Although many languages have a general imperfective, others have distinct aspects for one or more of its various roles, such as progressive, habitual, and iterative aspects. The imperfective contrasts with the perfective aspect, which is used to describe actions viewed as a complete whole.
#### Perfective
The perfective aspect (abbreviated PFV), sometimes called the aoristic aspect, is a grammatical aspect that describes an action viewed as a simple whole; i.e., a unit without interior composition. The perfective aspect is distinguished from the imperfective aspect, which presents an event as having internal structure (such as ongoing, continuous, or habitual actions).

\* Removing final -a is dialectical, standard usage it to include it
