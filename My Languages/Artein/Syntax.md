# Normal word order
Artein is an SOV language. The full word order is:
1. Particles
2. Subject
3. Time
4. Manner
5. Place
6. Object
7. Adverb
8. Verb

For example, using the sentence "I'm travelling to Munich by car today" would result in this sentence:

| Sentence parts | Artein      | Gloss              | English translation |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1. Subject     |             |                    |                     |
| 2. Time        | e-tin-∅     | LOC-this-PREP.SG   | at this             |
|                | mar-∅       | day-PREP.SG        | day                 |
| 3. Manner      | me-car-∅    | INS-car-PREP.SG    | with a car          |
| 4. Place       | da'-Munahèn | ALL-Munich-PREP.SG | to Munich           |
| 5. Object      |             |                    |                     |
| 6. Adverb      |             |                    |                     |
| 7. Verb        | i-cor-ar    | 1SG-go-FUT.PROG    | (I) will go         |

"Etin mar mecar da'Munahèn icorar"

Only the verb and subject are obligatory; all other parts are optional (unless the primary or finite verb is transitive, in which case a direct object is required).
# Questions and answers
Like Irish and Latin, Artein has no words for "yes" and "no". The answer to a question contains a repetition of the verb, either with or without a negative particle (e.g. Do you have a watch? I do).

Questions are formed by using the question particle [[mei]]:

<div id='outerTable'><table>
  <tr><td>Mei</td><td>o-ren-e?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Question word or particle'>Q</abbr></td><td><a class='sc'>1SG</a>-listen-<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Present tense'>PRS</abbr>.<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Progressive aspect'>PROG</abbr></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=2>Mei orene? — "Are you listening?"</td></tr>
</table></div>

# Commands
Commands are formed by using the imperative mood particle [[ta]]:

<div id='outerTable'><table>
  <tr><td>Ta</td><td>ren-e!</td></tr>
  <tr><td><abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Imperative mood'>IMP</abbr></td><td>listen-<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Present tense'>PRS</abbr>.<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Continuous aspect; continuative aspect'>CONT</abbr></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=2>Ta rene! — "[You] [will] listen [right now]!"</td></tr>
</table></div>
<i class='gmg-ack'>Gloss provided by <a href='https://neonnaut.github.io/'>Gloss My Gloss</a></i>

Commands directly addressing someone do not actually have to be inflected for 2nd person—and often aren't in colloquial speech—as the second person is implied from context.
