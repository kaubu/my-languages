# Normal word order
Artein is an SOV language. The full word order is:
1. Particles + Subject
2. Time
3. Manner
4. Place
5. Particles + Object
6. Adverb
7. Verb

For example, using the sentence "I'm travelling to Munich by car today" would result in this sentence:

| Sentence parts | Artein      | Gloss              | English translation |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1. Subject     |             |                    |                     |
| 2. Time        | e-tin-∅     | LOC-this-PREP.SG   | at this             |
|                | mar-∅       | day-PREP.SG        | day                 |
| 3. Manner      | me-car-∅    | INS-car-PREP.SG    | with a car          |
| 4. Place       | da'-Munahèn | ALL-Munich-PREP.SG | to Munich           |
| 5. Object      |             |                    |                     |
| 6. Adverb      |             |                    |                     |
| 7. Verb        | i-cor-ar    | 1SG-go-FUT.PROG    | (I) will go         |

"Etin mar mecar da'Munahèn icorar"

Only the verb and subject are obligatory; all other parts are optional (unless the primary or finite verb is transitive, in which case a direct object is required).
# Questions and answers
Like Irish and Latin, Artein has no words for "yes" and "no". The answer to a question contains a repetition of the verb, either with or without a negative particle (e.g. Do you have a watch? I do). Questions are formed with particles that are placed at the very start of the sentence.

Questions are formed by using the question particle [[mei]]:

<div id='outerTable'><table>
  <tr><td>mei</td><td>o-ren-e?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Question word or particle'>Q</abbr></td><td><a class='sc'>1SG</a>-listen-<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Present tense'>PRS</abbr>.<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Imperfective aspect'>IPFV</abbr></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=2>Mei orene? — "Are you listening?"</td></tr>
</table></div>

Negative questions are formed by using the particle [[nimei|nimeí]]:

<div id='outerTable'><table>
  <tr><td>nimei</td><td>duic</td><td>iénei</td></tr>
  <tr><td><abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Negation; negative'>NEG</abbr>.<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Question word or particle'>Q</abbr></td><td><a class='sc'>2SG</a>.<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Absolutive case'>ABS</abbr></td><td>tired</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=3>Nimei duic iénei — Aren't you tired?</td></tr>
</table></div>


# Commands
Commands are formed by using the imperative mood particle [[ta]]:

<div id='outerTable'><table>
  <tr><td>ta</td><td>rén-e!</td></tr>
  <tr><td><abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Imperative mood'>IMP</abbr></td><td>listen-<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Present tense'>PRS</abbr>.<abbr class='abbrv sc' title='Imperfective aspect'>IPFV</abbr></td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=2>Ta réne! — "[You] [will] listen [right now]!"</td></tr>
</table></div>

Commands directly addressing someone do not actually have to be inflected for 2nd person—and often aren't in colloquial speech—as the second person is implied from context.
